<h1>Small things I made in Python</h1>
<h2>Date calculator</h2>

A terminal date calculator. You write as arguments two dates in DD-MM-YYYY format*, compares them and prints the difference in days. It also accepts "today" as a parameter for both dates

<p>*: with -f or --format you can specify another format. "YMD" or "ISO" for YYYY-MM-DD and "MDY" or "American" for MM-DD-YYYY (ðŸ¤¢)</p>

<h2>Miku the Ripper (Python)</h2>

Had to use john the ripper to crack a hash for a cybersecurity exercise in my programming school. I wanted to practice Python so I made a simple dictionary-based attacker which first iterates the entire list and then tries every entry in the dictionary + every other one. Abandoned halfway as Python is simply too slow for this to be run in reasonable timeframes, probably gonna end up doing it in C or Rust.

<h1>In the Work in Progress branch</h1>

<h2>FlapPy Bird</h2>

Clone of Flappy Bird made in Python with the Pygame library to practice said lib.
